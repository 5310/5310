## Hullo There 👋

I'm Scio, also known as 5310.

(...It's supposed to be a numeronym of sort.)

As of 2026 I've moved to [Codeberg.org/Scio](https://codeberg.org/Scio). Most of my existing repositories still remain on GitHub, but I would be migrating them over slowly. Regardless, this GitHub account will remain available because a lot of the open source world still collaborates on GitHub.

You may reach me on [@Scio@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@Scio).
